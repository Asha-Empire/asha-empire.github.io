# Asha Empire Online

Get ready for the ultimate sci-fi gaming experience as you step into the world of the Asha Empire. Explore the vast galaxy, discover new planets, and lead your faction to victory. This game is a unique blend of strategy, RPG and FPS, where your choices matter and your skills are put to the test.

You'll start off on a single planet and embark on a journey to build your own empire. Travel to other planets, space stations and outposts as you expand your territory and increase your power. With a focus on safety, players are protected from attacking each other in designated safe zones.

Each character in the game is an NFT that can be bought, sold, and traded on the open market. Create an account, buy your NFT, and choose your character. You'll level up as you progress through the game, unlocking new technologies, weapons, vehicles, and spaceships.

Get ahead of the competition by establishing organizations, forming alliances, and creating your own regions, villages, and cities. Manage your resources and taxes wisely, as you collect revenue from your area and pay it back to the empire.

Take on dangerous missions, engage in thrilling battles, and explore the unknown. You'll need to get life insurance in the cities to ensure that your character will revive from its clone if it perishes in the game. But don't worry, while you're out of the game, your character will automatically sleep in the sleeping cube.

In the world of Asha Empire, you can extract different minerals, produce products, and engage in agriculture. Sell your goods on the local market or buy what you need. All transactions are made in AEC currency, a token that can be transferred or traded to your wallet.

Join the battle, forge your destiny, and become the ultimate ruler of the Asha Empire. Get ready for a thrilling sci-fi adventure that you'll never forget.
